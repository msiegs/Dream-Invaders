MOCKUPS:

1. Main Menu:

This mockup shows the Main Menu screen, which has a short label describing the story behind the game, a button to bring you to Start the game, and a button to bring you to the Instructions screen.
When the user interface is created for the actual game, I think the story label will be longer. I imagine that it will explain why Tyler is asleep, and why it is important for him to wake up. I will also change the fonts around on the buttons. I also imagine that I will find different locations for the buttons, and hopefully add an animation so that I can get the extra credit.


2. Game Start:

This mockup shows the Gameplay screen before the game has started.
When the user interface is created for the actual game, I will add a background image or color. To fit with the main menu, this will most likely just be an orange background. There also won't be lines between each invader, and they will be more evenly spaced and evenly sized. Finally, I will change the font and size of the two labels at the top, and will make each "life" an image of Tyler's head rather than a "/".


3. During Game:

This mockup shows the Gameplay screen during gameplay.
When the user interface is created for the actual game, I will edit the images of each invader to be completely transparent. Similar to the Game Start Mockup, I will also change the background color to orange, get rid of the lines between each invader, evenly space and size them, change the font colors on the labels, and add life images. In addition, I will change the bullet images for Tyler's bullets and the Invader's bullets. If time permits, I will try to add an explosion animation when an invader is hit by a bullet, and maybe sound effects as well. I will have three different drawings of the different healths of the barriers; if the barrier is hit once, part of the donut will disappear and appear to have been eaten.


4. Game Over:

This mockup shows the Game Over screen that appears when the player has lost all three lives or when the invaders have reached the bottom of the screen.
When the user interface is created for the actual game, I plan on editing the font for "GAME OVER!" completely. I will also modify the "START" button and make it more aesthetically pleasing. If time permits, I will also add a "MAIN MENU" button that would take the user back to the main menu; perhaps they lost because they didn't take the time to look at the instructions and now realize that they should read the instructions.
