HOW TO PLAY: 

-- SHOOT: UP Key	
-- MOVE LEFT: LEFT Key
-- MOVE RIGHT: RIGHT Key


GAME MECHANICS:

Press the start button to begin. When the game begins, the array of invaders will make their way to the right. When they hit the right border, they will move down, and then begin moving to the left until they hit the left border, at which point they will move down again, and then begin this loop again. As each column is destroyed completely, they will take longer to hit the border *HINT HINT*. If the invaders make it down all the way to the bottom of the screen, the player will get a Game Over. Now, as the invaders move around, they will try shooting at the player. This is completely randomized; the interval between shots is randomized as well as which invader will shoot. The player is protected by eight barriers, each of which has three health points. When the barrier has been hit three times in one round, it will disappear and leave the player more vulnerable to the invaders' bullets. Now, by using the UP Key, Tyler can shoot back at the aliens. Watch out; if Tyler shoots a barrier, it will lose health. Each time one of Tyler's bullets hits an invader, that invader will disappear and the player's score will be incremented by ten points. Occasionally (and randomly) a mystery ship will fly across the screen from right to left. If the player manages to shoot the mystery ship before it hits the left border and disappears then the player's score will be incremented by 100 points. Grab the opportunity while you can, because this mystery ship does not show up often! When an invader's bullet hits Tyler, the game pauses momentarily and the player loses a life. When the player has lost all 3 lives, the game is over. When the player has successfully cleared the screen of all invaders, they will move on to the next round; the barriers will be restored, the invaders will all reappear, and the invaders will now move at a quicker speed. The player's score and number of lives remain the same. This game can (theoretically) loop endlessly, but after a few rounds the player will find it incredibly difficult to keep the invaders from reaching the bottom of the screen. At that point, it's a matter of quick reactions, good strategy, and good predictions on where your bullets will hit. Good luck!
Note: This game is designed after the famous rapper, Tyler the Creator.
